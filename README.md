# 🥗 ChillChef: Healthy Meal Suggestion Based on Fridge Items

## 🌍 Problem Statement

Food waste is a critical global issue, with households discarding significant quantities of edible food due to a lack of awareness, planning, or creativity in meal preparation. Many people are unaware of how to effectively use leftover or aging ingredients in their refrigerator, leading to unnecessary waste and increased environmental impact.

Moreover, users struggle to find recipes that match the available ingredients, especially when common staples like spices, oil, or condiments are not explicitly listed but are assumed to be available.
