# 🥗 ChillChef: Healthy Meal Suggestion Based on Fridge Items

## 🌍 Problem Statement

Food waste is a critical global issue, with households discarding significant quantities of edible food due to a lack of awareness, planning, or creativity in meal preparation. Many people are unaware of how to effectively use leftover or aging ingredients in their refrigerator, leading to unnecessary waste and increased environmental impact.

Moreover, users struggle to find recipes that match the available ingredients, especially when common staples like spices, oil, or condiments are not explicitly listed but are assumed to be available.

## 💡 Proposed Solution

We propose an **AI-powered mobile application** that:

- 📸 Lets users scan (via OCR) or manually input fridge ingredients
- 🤖 Uses ML + NLP to recommend personalized recipes based on:
  - Available ingredients
  - Dietary preferences (e.g. vegetarian, keto)
  - Cuisine type
  - Common pantry items (e.g. oil, salt, pepper)
- 🧠 Offers smart grocery suggestions to complete missing recipes
- ⏳ Prioritizes ingredients nearing expiration
- 📊 Provides nutritional analysis and shelf-life tips
- 🌱 Promotes sustainable living through conscious cooking
